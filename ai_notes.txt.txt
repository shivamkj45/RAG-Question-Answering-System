"""
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps machines understand, interpret and generate human language.

Computer Vision allows machines to understand and analyze images and videos.

Applications of AI include healthcare, finance, education, autonomous vehicles and robotics.

Limitations of AI include bias in data, high computational cost and lack of human emotions.
